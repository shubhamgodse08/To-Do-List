# To-Do-List
The To-Do List project is a simple and efficient web application built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project aims to help users organize and manage their daily tasks and responsibilities in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Upon loading the web page, users are greeted with a clean and minimalist design that allows them to focus on their tasks without distractions. The interface consists of a text input box where users can add new tasks and a dynamic list that displays all the tasks they have added. 
When users enter a task into the input box and press the "Add" button, Javascript comes into action, capturing the task's content and appending it to the list. Each task item is accompanied by a checkbox, enabling users to mark tasks as completed when they are done. A delete button is also provided to remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed. 
The application uses local storage to persist the tasks, so users can close the page and return later without losing their to-do list. The use of local storage ensures that the data is stored on the user's device, maintaining privacy and reducing server-side overhead.
